    <Statement>Use variables to represent two quantities in a real-world problem that change in relationship to one another; write an equa-tion to express one quantity, thought of as the dependent variable, in terms of the other quantity, thought of as the inde-pendent variable. Analyze the relationship between the dependent and independent variables using graphs and tables, and relate these to the equation. For example, in a problem involving motion at constant speed, list and graph ordered pairs of distances and times, and write the equation d = 65t to represent the relationship between distance and time.</Statement>
