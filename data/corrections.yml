    Use the properties of exponents to interpret expressions for exponential functions.
    For example, identify percent rate of change in functions such as
    y = (1.02)<sup>t</sup>, y = (0.97)<sup>t</sup>, y = (1.01)<sup>12t</sup>, y = (1.2)<sup>t/10</sup>,
    and classify them as representing exponential growth or decay.
